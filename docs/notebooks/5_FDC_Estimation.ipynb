    "## Notes on k-nearest neighbours\n",
    "\n",
    "Time series streamflow records vary widely in their temporal coverage, and finding k-nearest neighbours presents a tradeoff between selecting nearest neighbours and maximizing the number of observations concurrent with the target.  From the literature, concurrency is assured by pre-selecting a subset of stations with continuous records over a common period of record, or by infilling gaps with k-nearest neighbours simulation.  Some kind of tradeoff must be made, and we aim to use a method that maximizes information content while minimizing the number of assumptions.  The following notes are intended to clarify the implications of using k-nearest neighbours to fill gaps in the time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Infilled-by-kNN != Independent Proxy**: If a gap in an observation record is inferred from neighbors, it becomes redundant in the ensemble and increases the weight of the other (k minus n) neighbours.  So at that time step, its influence is non-unique, and including it in the ensemble is functionally equivalent to using the same set of other proxies directly, or just reducing the ensemble size.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inflated Ensemble Size**: Filling gaps by \"nested\" k-nearest neighbours inflates the expresed number of independent neighbors.  Comparing the effectiveness of ensemble simulations as a function of k is then misleading because the effective number of independent proxies is *at most* k. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Information leakage risk**: If you repeatedly use kNN to fill missing data from within the same pool, especially when simulating extreme values, you risk suppressing variability by biasing toward the central tendency of the ensemble.  This defeats one of the core motivations for kNN: to preserve structure and variability from observations at neighboring stations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address the nuance above, we propose three time-based methods for selecting k-nearest neighbours beyond strictly nodes in the network.  The problem is related to the set-cover problem where the goal is to select a subset of stations that maximizes the intersection of their data availability over a specified time period.  The following sections outline the three methods for selecting k-nearest neighbours based on availability of concurrent data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary: Set-Theoretic Foundations of Strict k-NN Concurrency Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is closely related to classic combinatorial and set-theoretic optimization problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Set-Theoretic Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Let each column $( S_i \\subseteq T )$ represent the set of timestamps where station $( i )$ has valid (non-NaN) data.  \n",
    "Let $( \\mathcal{S} = \\{ S_1, S_2, \\dots, S_n \\} )$ be the collection of all such subsets, sorted by proximity (e.g., distance or attribute similarity).  \n",
    "The goal is to select a subset $( \\mathcal{K} \\subset \\mathcal{S} )$ such that:\n",
    "- $( |\\mathcal{K}| = k )$\n",
    "- $( \\bigcap_{S \\in \\mathcal{K}} S )$ satisfies a temporal completeness constraint (e.g., ≥5 years with ≥10 observations in each of 12 months)\n",

    "\n",
    "In order to fairly test how parametric and non-parametric pdf estimation methods compare to each other, we need a consistent way to deal with indeterminate cases where the simulated distribution does not provide support coverage of the \"ground truth\" observations.  I feel two ways about this: the KL divergence is the culprit here, and the problem could be avoided by choosing another divergence measure.  However the definintion of KL divergence in information theoretic terms of compression make it seem more foundational than other measures, but ultimately is this true?  Should we look to math statistics to make more direct links between f-divergences and what we use as a discriminant for a particular application?  Should we be more concerned about \"Bayesian consistency\" of the discriminant (or surrogate loss function) with the choice of divergence measure?\n",

    "A desirable property of the prior is that it reflects the strength of belief in the model (data), where a smaller prior reflects stronger belief in the data/model and vice versa.  Dividing by the number of observations has such an effect, however it also makes for very small priors.  The consequence of very small priors is they have negligible effect on models that provide complete support coverage, and they severely penalize models that do not, resulting in a form of instability.  The very small prior creates a heavy tail in the distribution of a large sample of KL divergences, with further downstream effects in optimization.  \n",
