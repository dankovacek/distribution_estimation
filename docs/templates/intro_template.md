# FDC Estimation Results Archive

This repository contains the results of an exercise in the estimation of streamflow variability for a large sample of hydrologically diverse catchments in and around British Columbia, Canada.

Each station folder contains an html file with a summary of the results.

### HYSETS Dataset

The active and historical monitoring stations examined in this dataset are a subset of the HYSETS dataset (Arsenault et al., 2020).

### Meteorological Inputs

The meteorological data used in the LSTM model is derved from Daymet {cite}`thornton2022daymet`. The data is available at a 1km resolution and includes the following variables:

* `tmax`: Maximum daily temperature [°C]
* `tmin`: Minimum daily temperature [°C]
* `prcp`: Daily precipitation [mm]
* `srad`: Daily shortwave radiation [W/m²]
* `vp`: Daily vapor pressure [Pa]
* `swe`: Daily snow water equivalent [mm]

The data were pre-processed to yield catchment-averaged daily timeseries.  The Processed Catchment-Averaged Meteorological Forcings from Daymet for Streamflow Monitored Catchments in British Columbia, and Transboundary Basins {cite}`kovacek2025metforcings` are available at [https://doi.org/10.5683/SP3/65FXAS](https://doi.org/10.5683/SP3/65FXAS). 


Derived variables include:
* `tmean`: Mean daily temperature [°C]
* `pet`: Potential evapotranspiration [mm/day] (computed using the Penman-Monteith equation)
